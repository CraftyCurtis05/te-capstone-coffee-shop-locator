Coffee Shop Locator Web Application

Worked within a group to design and develop a web application that utilizes Vue.js to allow a user to login and perform address searches, using Yelp Fusion API, 
to discover the closest 20 coffee shops near their location. Utilized the JSON from Yelp API to display necessary coffee shop details from the search.
